<h3>What is this?</h3>

This is a repository that can make your inserting your favourite ROM to your samsung device, best, with no more pesky hardware requirements, " *looking at you, super-patch with no proper WSL1 support* "

Right now, the options are very confusing at best:

![wth](images/cvs-recipt.png) 

istg this is hell-looking, im still new with the yaml stuff

and the source structure is uhhhhhhh:

![oh_naw_hell_naw_tf_man](images/someone-dont-let-him-cook-yaml-because-this-is-beyond-raiden-ei-cooking-here.png)

![frieren](images/Sousou-no-Frieren-Frieren-portada.webp)

I swear ill clean this up, in the coming updates of the script and make it easy to use at least

<div align=center>

### Why is this
